# Lesswrong v2.0 Anti-Kibitzer

This is a user script (for use with Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, or the like) which hides usernames and vote scores on the 2.0
version of [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com). Usernames are replaced with randomly colored bars.  This makes threaded
conversations easier to understand.
